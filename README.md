#About this fork
I've added edition for polygons. To use this, pass following parameters to drawing options:

````
var options = {
  edition: true
}
````

#Leaflet.draw
Adds support for drawing polys to Leaflet.

Check out the [demo](http://jacobtoye.github.com/Leaflet.draw/)

This plugin was inspired by @brunob's [draw plugin](https://github.com/brunob/leaflet.draw). I decided to create a new repo rather than forking as I wanted to take the coding style and functionality in a different direction.

#Using the plugin
If you are happy with the control being displayed below the zoom controls just set ````drawControl = true```` when declaring your Leaflet map.

E.g.:

````
var cloudmadeUrl = 'http://{s}.tile.cloudmade.com/BC9A493B41014CAABB98F0471D759707/997/256/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
cloudmade = new L.TileLayer(cloudmadeUrl, {maxZoom: 18}),
map = new L.Map('map', {layers: [cloudmade], center: new L.LatLng(-37.7772, 175.2756), zoom: 15, drawControl: true });
````

If you would like to reposition the control, turn off a tyep or customize the styles then add the control manually:

````
var drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
	position: 'topright',
	drawPolyline: false
});
map.addControl(drawControl);
````

See [example/map-polydraw.html](https://github.com/jacobtoye/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/example/drawing.html) for a working example.

#Customize shape styles

L.Control.Draw can take an options object. You can specify a styles property like so:

````
var options = {
	styles: {
		polyine: {
			color: '#f357a1',
			width: 10
		},
		polygon: {
			color: '#bada55'
		},
		rectangle: {
			clickable: false
		}
	}
}
````

The shape styles are the leaflet [Path](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html#path-options) and [Polyline](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/reference.html#polyline-options) options.

#Official support
Leaflet plan to include drawing in 0.4 so this is just a band-aid until it comes. See https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/174
